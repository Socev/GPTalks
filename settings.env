#Flask requires a secret key for security purposes. The secret key is used to encrypt session cookies, which are used to store user information between requests. If the secret key is not set, the session data can be easily tampered with or stolen, compromising the security of the application. The secret key should be a long, randomly generated string that is kept secret and not shared with anyone.
